# Algorithmable

Useful algorithms such as Sorting Strategies, Searches and Data Structures such as symbol tables, binary search tree BST, red black tree RBT, 
hash tables, bag, linked list, deque, queue FIFO, stack LIFO, graphs & Graph Traversal strategies for everyday usage. 

Algorithms and Data Structures implemented using Ruby, for fun.

Library also contains solutions for several puzzles solved by implemented algorithms and data structures.

## Data Structures

- Bag (primitive collection without ability to delete elements)
- Doubly Linked List
- Deque (double-ended queue)
- Queue (FIFO)
- Stack (LIFO)
- Ordered Symbol Table BST. Implementation using Unbalanced Binary Search Tree.

## Graphs

- Undirected graph

## Graph Traversals

- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Death First Search (DFS)

## Search Algorithms

- Binary Search

## Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble sort
- Merge sort
- Heapsort ( Binary Heap )

# Usage

It is always better to check unit tests in order to understand how things going on. 
Most of the components are encapsulated through the factory methods, so the are could be mixed to other objects.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'algorithmable'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install algorithmable
